    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">How to Import a Car from Germany to Lithuania</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">Importing a used car from Germany is one of the most popular options for Lithuanian buyers. Germany offers a huge selection of vehicles, competitive prices, and relatively high vehicle standards. This guide will walk you through each step of the process ‚Äî from choosing the right car to final registration in Lithuania.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Why Germany?</h2>
    <p>Germany has one of the largest used car markets in Europe. Cars are typically well-maintained, with service histories and lower mileage. Platforms like mobile.de and autoscout24.eu offer thousands of listings daily.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Find and Verify the Car</h2>
    <p>Always check the VIN through services like CarVertical or AutoDNA. Request maintenance records, registration papers, and seller verification. Avoid listings with missing service history or vague seller information.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Purchase Process</h2>
    <p>You‚Äôll need a signed sales contract, an invoice, and original German registration documents (Teil I & II). Clarify which documents will be handed over on-site ‚Äî missing Teil II or a delayed post delivery can block registration in Lithuania.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. VAT & Tax Considerations</h2>
    <p>If you're buying from a VAT-registered dealer, intra-EU supply rules apply ‚Äî you may be exempt from German VAT (0%) if properly documented. But be prepared to declare VAT in Lithuania, especially as a business buyer or when importing a new car.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Transport Options to Lithuania</h2>
    <p>You can drive the car yourself using transit plates (Kurzzeitkennzeichen) or hire a professional car carrier. Make sure the vehicle is insured for the trip. Transport prices vary ‚Äî compare open vs. closed trailer offers, and check for loading delays.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Registration in Lithuania</h2>
    <p>To register your imported vehicle, you‚Äôll need: invoice, foreign registration documents, proof of ownership, COC (Certificate of Conformity), and in some cases, customs declarations. Additionally, you must have valid Lithuanian insurance and a valid German T√úV (technical inspection) or complete a fresh inspection in Lithuania. Prepare to visit VƒÆ "Regitra" with all paperwork in hand.</p>

<!--     <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">SDK Code Requirement</h2>
    <p>Before scheduling your registration, request an SDK code (Savivaldybƒós Duomen≈≥ Kodas). This code is required to start any registration procedure in Lithuania. You can apply for SDK online or at Regitra directly ‚Äî bring purchase documents and foreign papers.</p> -->

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">SDK Code Requirement</h2>
    <p>Before scheduling your registration, request an SDK code (Savivaldybƒós Duomen≈≥ Kodas). This code is required to start any registration procedure in Lithuania. You can apply for SDK online or at Regitra directly ‚Äî bring purchase documents and foreign papers.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">‚ö†Ô∏è The SDK code must be obtained <strong>before the vehicle enters Lithuanian territory</strong>. Customs and border control authorities may conduct routine checks, and if the vehicle is addressed to a Lithuanian resident, company, or citizen, but the SDK code has not been issued in advance, this may lead to penalties for both the future owner and the transport company carrying the vehicle.</p>
    
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">üëâ Tips & Common Pitfalls</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700">
      <li>Never rely on verbal promises ‚Äî ensure all vehicle data is documented.</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt pay cash via drivers or middlemen during transport ‚Äî this is unsafe and undocumented.</li>
      <li>Check if the car has a COC; otherwise, you might need to order one for a fee.</li>
      <li>Be sure the seller gives you both parts of the German registration.</li>
    </ul>
