    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Car Transport Options to the Baltics</h1>

    <p class="mb-4">When purchasing a vehicle from abroad, choosing the right transport method is just as important as the deal itself. Whether you're buying from Germany, the Netherlands, or elsewhere in the EU, this guide explains your options for getting your car safely and legally to the Baltic region.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Open Trailer Transport</h2>
    <p>This is the most common and cost-effective method. Your car is loaded onto a multi-car open trailer and delivered to your destination. It's ideal for standard cars and buyers prioritizing price over pristine condition.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Enclosed Transport</h2>
    <p>Enclosed trailers protect your vehicle from weather, road debris, and visibility. Itâ€™s more expensive but a great choice for premium, rare, or freshly repaired vehicles.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Self-Driving the Vehicle</h2>
    <p>You can pick up the car yourself using transit plates and temporary insurance. This gives flexibility and allows inspection before taking delivery, but it adds wear and requires proper documents (Kurzzeitkennzeichen, green card, etc.).</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Professional Driver or Shuttle Service</h2>
    <p>In some cases, professional drivers can deliver the car under contract. It's faster than trailer transport and flexible for urgent deliveries, but less common and usually more expensive.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mt-6">Still unsure which option fits your case? We help clients compare quotes, choose the right service, and avoid paperwork issues at customs and registration.</p>
