    <p class="mb-4">If you're planning to buy a car abroad and take it on a long trip across Europe, it’s important to understand that road rules vary by country — especially when it comes to phone use while driving. This article highlights the most severe penalties across the EU to help you avoid costly mistakes and stay safe on the road.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Using your phone while driving is prohibited across Europe, but some countries impose far stricter penalties than others — including license suspension, mandatory court appearances, and even jail time. Here’s what every driver should know.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Belgium</h2>
    <p>Minimum fine of €174, immediate 15-day license suspension, mandatory court appearance. In severe cases, drivers can face up to 7 days in jail. Enforcement is strict and judicial costs often increase the total penalty.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Norway</h2>
    <p>Known for Europe’s highest fine for phone use while driving — €867. Zero tolerance policy with frequent roadside checks.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Italy</h2>
    <p>Fines range from €422 to €1,697. First offenses may lead to a 15–60 day license suspension. Repeat offenders risk up to 3 months.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Netherlands</h2>
    <p>Fine of €380, with consistent enforcement. Officers regularly monitor both highways and urban traffic.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Spain</h2>
    <p>Fine of €200 and 6 license points deducted. Spain operates a strict demerit-point system, and mobile phone violations are heavily penalized.</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mt-6">
      Be cautious while driving abroad — traffic law enforcement in the EU is increasingly unified and digitalized. Mobile phone use might seem minor, but the consequences are serious.
