    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Top 5 Mistakes to Avoid When Buying a Car Abroad</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">If you're planning to buy a car abroad, take a moment to read these top five pitfalls to avoid. They could save you time, money, and frustration â€” especially when dealing with taxes, export and import paperwork, or delivery.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Ignoring VAT Rules for New Vehicles</h2>
    <p>Even within the EU, buying a car from another EU country can come with unexpected VAT charges â€” especially for vehicles considered 'new' (less than 6 months old or 6,000 km).</p>
    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Real Experience:</strong> A buyer from Estonia purchased a car in Germany and paid 19% German VAT. But when registering it in Estonia, local authorities charged 20% Estonian VAT. Only after submitting all documents did the seller process the refund.</p>
    <p class="mt-2"><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Tip:</strong> Always confirm if the seller supports VAT refunds. Not all do!</p>

<!--     <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Not Verifying Vehicle History</h2>
    <p>Check VIN history through platforms like CarVertical, AutoDNA, and always request service records.</p> -->

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Not Verifying Vehicle History</h2>
    <p>Check the VIN through platforms like CarVertical or AutoDNA, and always request service records and ownership history.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">In real-world cases, many used vehicles listed on sites like <em>mobile.de</em> or <em>autoscout24.eu</em> may have been previously damaged and restored. Often, these cars originate from leasing auctions after accidents. Some VIN check databases can still access archived auction photos showing original damage or defects.</p>
    <p class="mt-2">However, no report is 100% reliable â€” not all damage history is captured. For valuable purchases, itâ€™s wise to hire a local vehicle inspector who can physically evaluate the car and provide a detailed report with photos, paint thickness readings, and technical diagnostics.</p>

<!--     <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Underestimating Import Paperwork</h2>
    <p>You'll need a sales invoice, Certificate of Conformity, export declaration (outside of EU), and possibly more. Missing papers can delay or block registration.</p> -->

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Underestimating Import Paperwork</h2>
    <p>You'll need a sales invoice, Certificate of Conformity, export declaration (outside of EU), and possibly more. Missing papers can delay or block registration.</p>
    <p class="mt-2"><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Tip:</strong> Ask the seller in advance which documents youâ€™ll receive when picking up the car. In many cases, only one part of the registration certificate is available immediately â€” with the second part promised by post. This can be risky and may delay your registration. Also note that if the Certificate of Conformity (COC) is missing, you might need to purchase it separately from a dealership in your country.</p>

    <p>Driving it yourself? Hiring a carrier? Each has different costs and documents â€” plan ahead and compare.</p> -->

    <p class="mt-2"><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Tip:</strong> Never hand cash or authorize a transporter to pay for the car on your behalf. Road transport already involves risk â€” adding a cash purchase makes it even more vulnerable. Even if the amount seems small and legal, you have no guarantee of how or whether the payment will be delivered or documented correctly.</p>

<!--     <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Trusting the Wrong Seller</h2>
    <p>Scams exist. Work with reputable dealers and verify all listings. Avoid large transfers before seeing the car or documents.</p> -->

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">5. Trusting the Wrong Seller</h2>
    <p>Scams exist. Work with reputable dealers and verify all listings. Avoid large transfers before seeing the car or documents.</p>
    <p class="mt-2"><strong>ðŸ‘‰ Tip:</strong> Always verify the seller's company details and confirm that the vehicle is physically present at their location. Cross-check the legal registration data and bank account information â€” scammers often create fake listings with attractive prices and send forged invoices using real dealer names but fraudulent bank details. Be cautious with online marketplaces and unusually low offers.</p>
