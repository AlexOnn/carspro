    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Top Auction Platforms in Europe</h1>

    <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">When it comes to finding and purchasing a car at a competitive price — whether you're buying in bulk or searching for a specific model not available on public marketplaces — you will eventually come across vehicle auctions. In this article, we explore several major platforms, including autobid.de, autorola.eu, and auto1. Keep in mind that some of the simplified descriptions here may differ from the official auction terms, as we aim to provide an accessible overview of complex dealer-focused systems.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Autobid.de</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">A conservative German auction network with physical auction sites in cities like Munich, Hamburg, Berlin, and Frankfurt. Buyers can participate either in person or online. Vehicles typically come with detailed equipment specs, condition reports, and documentation. Commission fees range from 2.7% to 3.5%, but never less than €500. If the car is eligible for VAT refund within the EU, transportation must be carried out by a logistics partner officially registered with the auction house.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Autorola</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">An online auction platform offering cars from various European logistics hubs. The system supports both fixed prices and bidding formats. Cars are typically ex-leases from EU fleet companies. Main buyers include EU, EEA, and Middle East dealers. Commission fees range between €500 and €1,000. Delivery is more flexible, but individual buyers cannot participate directly and will need a broker. Vehicle condition reports vary greatly, and prices are often 10–20% below public listings. Caution is advised with unfamiliar sellers.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3. Auto1</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">This model offers both bidding and fixed price sales. Most of the inventory comes from private EU sellers, sourced via a related company within the same group. The platform handles quick resale but often involves hidden defects. Suspiciously low prices are often a red flag. Additionally, their complex release system requires advance appointments for vehicle pickup. Failure to collect on time may result in storage fees of €25–35/day depending on country.</p>
